# Introduction

Every time you make a call to 311, register for a construction permit, or see your streets cleaned, you're seeing your tax dollars at work. You're also seeing public data being made. The public's right to government information, even before it was stored in databases, has been a cornerstone of modern civics: access to government data allows constituents to understand what their public institutions do and how their money is being spent.

New York City has been a global leader in making data that is created in the public interest publicly available. In 1993, when the World Wide Web was still in its infancy, the NYC Commission on Public Information and Communication published the first-of-its-kind “Public Data Directory.” Two decades later, the City implemented its pioneering "Open Data Law" in 2012, which requires all City agencies to publish every public dataset they maintain on the Open Data Portal.

In this report, you'll find specific examples of ways 20 City agencies are becoming more transparent than ever by publishing new datasets. But the real promise of Open Data is not about what the City does: it's about you. Data is not truly "open" unless it is open to everyone. Over the past two years, my administration's Open Data for All strategy has helped realize the promise of open information by putting data into the hands of New Yorkers, as evidenced by the land use advocates, small businesses, community boards, CUNY students, researchers, inter-faith organizers – New Yorkers from all five boroughs – who are featured in the report using open data to make a difference in their communities.

We want to hear from you: request a dataset for release. Leave a comment on the Open Data portal. But most importantly, find problems in your community and solve them with Open Data -- or let us know how you think we can. Open data doesn’t exist in NYC just because it’s a best practice. Five years after open data became law, the program thrives because it still enjoys support and pressure from a variety of community stakeholders.

I hope you'll join us in our continued efforts to making Open Data for All.
