# Compliance Plan

The Open Data Law requires the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) to publish an annual Compliance Plan. The tables below capture these reporting requirements, including a full dataset publishing schedule, changes in release dates listed on previous Open Data Plans, data disclosures in Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) responses, information on datasets maintained on agency websites, and datasets eligible for geospatial standardization.

The compliance plan is also available for download as an [.xlsx file here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/2017_compliance_plan_final.xlsx).
