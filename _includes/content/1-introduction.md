# Dear New Yorkers,

Every time you call 311, register for a construction permit, or see your streets cleaned, you’re seeing your government at work. Whether or not you realize it, you're also seeing public data being made.

Your  right to government information, even before it was stored in databases, is a cornerstone of modern civics. Access to government data allows you to understand what your public institutions do for you and how your tax dollars are being spent.

When it comes to public availability of government data, New York City is a global leader. In 1993, when the World Wide Web was still in its infancy, the NYC Commission on Public Information and Communication published the first-of-its-kind “Public Data Directory.” Two decades later, the City implemented its pioneering "Open Data Law" in 2012, which requires all City agencies to publish every public dataset they maintain on the Open Data Portal.

In this report, you'll find specific examples of ways some of our 80 participating agencies are becoming more transparent than ever by publishing new datasets. But the real promise of Open Data is not about what the City does: it's about New Yorkers, it’s about you. Our data is not truly "open" unless it is open for everyone. Over the past two years, our Open Data for All strategy has helped realize the promise of open information by putting data into the hands of New Yorkers — land use advocates, small businesses, community boards, CUNY students, researchers, inter-faith organizers, people from all five boroughs – who are featured in this report using open data to make a difference in their communities. We hope these stories will inspire you to think about how you can make positive change in your community.

We want to hear from you. Request a dataset for release. Leave a comment on the Open Data portal. But most importantly, find problems in your community and solve them with Open Data -- or let us know how you think we can. NYC Open Data is about creating a dialogue between you and your City. Five years after open data became law, the program thrives because New Yorkers like you are engaging openly with their government and the wealth of data it creates.
 
We hope you'll join us in our continued efforts to making Open Data for All.

—NYC Open Data team
