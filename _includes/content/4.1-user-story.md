For Tara Kelly and Marcel Negret, NYC Open Data has been a crucial component of their advocacy efforts and public data tools. Both work at the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group advocating for preservation and planning, which this year published an [interactive online map](https://www.mas.org/ourwork/colp/) of the 14,000+ properties owned by the City of New York. This map, which uses the Department of City Planning's [City Owned and Leased Property](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Owned-and-Leased-Property-COLP-/c2g8-ercv) dataset, is designed to provide decision makers, planning practitioners, and the public with information so that everyone can identify opportunities for improving, protecting, and utilizing City property. The tool allows New Yorkers to navigate City data;  and also exposes ways that the dataset is incomplete or out-of-date; when this is the case, the organization “actively advocates for new City data to be published,” according to Marcel. In addition, the Municipal Art Society has used Open Data to provide evidence in testimony related to neighborhood rezonings and other land use actions. Recently, the group used Open Data in advocating for a group of zoning variance processes run by the Board of Standards and Appeals, which was approved by the mayor in May. As Tara explains, “We use Open Data as much as we can in our advocacy to substantiate anything we’re saying.”
