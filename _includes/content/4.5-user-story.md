Grand St. Settlement, a settlement house and historic service provider in the Lower East Side

Grand Street Settlement, a settlement house centered in East Village with many branches,  provides social services for low-income neighborhoods by running summer camps, meals and programming for seniors, and early childhood activities. For Lauren Santorso, Open Data has contributed to her broader efforts to make the organization’s operations more data-driven. Previously, workers weren’t using data to its fullest extent, as “data wasn’t being rolled up and utilized in a way that could be useful” to the community workers. Lauren and her team have worked to change that by packaging a monthly data report that improves the efficiency of their work on early childhood initiatives.

In the future, Lauren hopes to use Open Data and mapping tools to create a tool for workers to identify areas where council districts and congressional district lines overlap to better identify areas of need.
