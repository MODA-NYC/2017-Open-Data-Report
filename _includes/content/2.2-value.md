## Encourage purposeful and easy engagement.

Open Data is a platform that should be used as a tool for feedback. The initiative succeeds through the participation and oversight of community stakeholders --- old and new. After user research indicated that the digital interface of the Open Data catalog was confusing and intimidating to new users, the Open Data team committed to building a new, more accessible website through collaborative engagement with users. In partnership with the DoITT NYC Gov Lab and Studio UX team, the Open Data team leveraged human-centered design (HCD) methodology in designing the website, engaging high-frequency users in a design charrette and community groups in user testing sessions. The revamped Portal includes a new [Open Data Help Desk](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/), powered by the Screendoor application that streamlines several feedback channels. In the four months since the Help Desk launched, the team has received more than 400 new comments and inquiries. The new system not only enables the team to better respond to user needs, but to also collect data on inquiry types. This valuable source of information helps ensure that technology updates and new tutorials are based on known user needs. Substantive engagement must be standard for Open Data.
