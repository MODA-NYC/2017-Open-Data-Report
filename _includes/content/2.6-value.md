## Learn, test, standardize â€“ and learn again.

We must test our assumptions and try new ideas, collect information on our efforts, and analyze our performance seeking opportunities for improvement. Open Data lies at the intersection of participatory government, open information, and pioneering government technology. Like these forward-thinking fields, Open Data is not static, and the City's Open Data work should continue to adapt to the changing data ecosystem. This spring, the Open Data team added four new full-time staff to its ranks. MODA hired a Director of Civic Engagement and a Special Advisor to ensure that the program remains at the vanguard of the field, while responding to user needs (and needs of the Open Data Coordinators). DoITT hired two new data coordinators, adding to the team's capacity to publish and maintain datasets. In addition, more agencies than ever are investing resources in their data publishing efforts as the business case and civic imperative for Open Data becomes clearer.
