Harpreet Singh Wahan was among the community members who participated in an NYC Parks Open Data for All Workshop, based on a curriculum developed by BetaNYC. Harpreet, a Community Board Member in Queens, says Open Data is crucial for leaders who want to make a difference in their communities. "Thankfully, the Mayor has opened up this great information, which can be leveraged to optimize and make great policy decisions, whether it's through analyzing tree populations or ethnographic data. Community leaders should be identified and trained, and they can in turn bring these learnings back to their communities," he says.  The president and founder of the [Flushing Interfaith Council]( https://flushinginterfaithcouncil.wordpress.com/), Harpreet has high hopes for using Open Data to bring people and communities together in the future, especially those of different faiths. For Harpreet, "Open Data can help bridge the gaps between faiths and bridge our cultures." He works with the Columbia Journalism School in a partnership to bring budding journalists to different houses of worship and introduce them to different religious faiths. In an effort to promote greater understanding of the diversity of religions in New York City and the world; Open Data has helped the partnership find previously unknown houses of worship.
