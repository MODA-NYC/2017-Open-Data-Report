## American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)

For the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), geospatial datasets available on NYC Open Data have allowed their mapping specialists to overlay political boundaries on the organization’s NYC-specific service areas. Boundary shapefiles for [borough](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm), [police precincts](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Police-Precincts/78dh-3ptz), and [neighborhood tabulation areas](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhq), along with [NYCHA locations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Map-of-NYCHA-Developments/i9rv-hdr5) and the [street centerline files](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b), “have helped us to better understand our communities we serve, and to ensure we are working in the areas of most critical need,” says Nada O’Neal, Vice President of Information Technology at ASPCA. Headquartered in New York City since it was founded over 150 years ago, ASPCA has a long history of partnering with the City, from efforts to improve law enforcement efforts around cruelty complaints ([311 Service Requests from 2010 to present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)), to helping residents create pet emergency plans ([Ready NY events](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Ready-NY-Events/hyur-qpyf)), to increasing pet adoption, as when the ASPCA turned City Hall into “Kitty Hall” for a cat adoption event last month ([NYC Permitted Event Information](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Permitted-Event-Information/tvpp-9vvx)).
