# Six Open Data Values

## Start with Users

The first step in opening data is focusing on demand. This spring, the Open Data team partnered with Reboot, a social impact firm dedicated to inclusive development and accountable governance, to better understand current users of Open Data, as well as identify new user groups and engagement tactics for New Yorkers who our efforts to date have not reached. In May, Reboot publicly presented the results of their research, which leveraged applied urban ethnography and design research to build user personas and a memo featuring actionable recommendations on how to engage new users. This research is giving us the evidence we need to be strategic and tactical about engaging with the spur demand in communities less familiar to Open Data.

## Treat the Publication of the dataset as the first step of ‘opening’ data

If you publish a dataset but no one uses it, is it really “open”? In addition to its partnership with DoITT on Open Data, the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics partners with CIty agencies on analytics projects, working to make services better, faster, and is committing to making the process, not just results, open to the public. Open Source Analytics is the scaffolding that the public sector needs to deliver on the promise of open data.

The traditional approach of handing over a ‘product’ of conclusions of the analysis with no insight into how the analysis was done is inadequate. Also simply putting code up on a github repository doesn’t go far enough. Open Source Analytics is about transparency throughout the process.

Making the analysis open source opens us up to critique from other (perhaps non-govt) stakeholders. This is a positive thing and an acknowledgment of the fact that there may be many sides to an issue, but that dialog is always a good thing. It also opens up the field to other viewpoints not previously considered. Working in government holds us to a higher standard to be transparent about our goals and process.

## Encourage purposeful and easy engagement

Open Data is a platform that should be used as a tool for feedback. The initiative succeeds through the participation and oversight of community stakeholders -- old and new. The revamped Open Data Portal includes a new “Contact Us” page, powered by the forms-app Screendoor, that makes it easier than ever before to get in touch with the NYC Open Data. The new application streamlines several ad hoc feedback channels. In the four months since its launch, the team has received more than 800 new comments and inquiries, x of which were responded to in x days. Not only is the team able to better respond to user needs; it also provides a valuable source of information for understanding users and ensuring that technology updates and programmatic decisions are made with known needs in  mind. Substantive engagement is more than an obligation; it must be default for Open Data.

## Empower agencies

By empowering Open Data Coordinators and champions in every agency and office, the City helps narrow the gap between agency experts and Open Data users. Previously, all of the Mayor’s Office was served by a single Open Data Coordinator. This spring, MODA partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Operations to dig deeper into every service area and understand the data ecosystem of City Hall. Operations recruited over 35 new Open Data Coordinators from individual offices and divisions, including new data publishers such as the Mayor’s Office of Climate Policy and Programs and the programs such as the Young Men’s Initiative. This effort resulted in over (x) datasets added for publication on the Open Data Portal.

## Integrate Open Data into citywide processes

As Open Data becomes routine across NYC government, we will look for opportunities to make small changes in existing processes. The Mayor’s Office of Technology and Innovation (MOTI) hosted a “Broadband Data Dig” at Brooklyn Public Library in November. Broadband experts, civic technologists, and data scientists joined one another to analyze and develop recommendations for New York City’s digital infrastructure based on newly-released local and federal broadband data. The data for this event includes a block-level look at broadband availability in New York City (from federal data), and development-by-development information about broadband at the New York City Housing Authority. Participants used the datasets to help the City better understand the factors impacting broadband adoption, develop solutions to address broadband inequities, and design broadband data collection and maintenance policies. Opening data requires more than making it available: Open Data is a tool to engage subject matter experts and interested novices in the information the City produces, and give them a voice in the decisions their government makes.

## Learn, test, standardize -- and learn again

We must test our assumptions and try new ideas, collect information on our efforts, and analyze our performance for points of improvement. The Open Data lies at the participatory politics, open information, and pioneering government technology, and should continue to adapt to the changing data ecosystem. This spring, MODA and DoITT hired four new full-time staff, including a Director of Civic Engagement and a Special Advisor [for Research and Knowledge Management],  to ensure that the program remains at the vanguard and in touch with user and ODC needs.
