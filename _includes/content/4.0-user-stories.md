In the [2015 Open Data Plan](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2015/NYC-Open-Data-Plan-2015.pdf), Mayor de Blasio's administration declared Open Data for All, an ambitious vision for a future where open data is not just available but useful to everyone. On the fifth anniversary of the [Open Data Law](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/), New York City's Chief Analytics Officer made a promise: going forward, the public face of Open Data will not be a City official, but rather New Yorkers who have used public City data to improve their lives and their communities. In line with this promise, we present here stories of New Yorkers who have used Open Data to make a difference in all five boroughs.

These examples do not capture all the stories of New Yorkers using Open Data. Tell us yours. We encourage you to [get in touch](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/), and share your own Open Data story with our team.
