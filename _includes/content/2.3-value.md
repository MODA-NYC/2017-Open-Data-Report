## Treat the publication of the dataset as the first step of opening data.

In New York City, "open" data should be "useful" data. A practical expression of this Open Data value is MODA's commitment to Open Source Analytics, an understanding of "analytics" as a process that can be replicated elsewhere. In addition to partnering with DoITT on Open Data, MODA works with City agencies on advanced data analytics projects to make services better, faster, and more equitable. Simply handing over a finished set of metrics at the end of an analytics project limits civil servants' insight into how the analysis was done, and stifles further improvements on the models. The individual steps taken -- including what type of analysis was selected and why, insights gained from subject matter experts, and disclaimers on source data -- is just as important as the results. Data analysts working in government should be held to a higher standard of transparency about goals, process, and results. "Open sourcing" analytics efforts not only increases visibility into the way City agencies use data and develop algorithms. It also helps spread awareness of the power of Open Data and data science in municipal service delivery. To this end, this fall MODA will release an online project library and documentation on its Open Source Analytics implementation framework.
