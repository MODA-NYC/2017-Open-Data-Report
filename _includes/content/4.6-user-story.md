# Open Data for Job Placement

Open data has enabled Mary make more informed decisions while implementing her programs. It has also been a tool for telling compelling, evidence-based stories of the local community. Mary explains that [local partner organizations]“community partners were getting overwhelmed” by all of the data that they were facing, and were unsure of how to proceed. Working with VizAlytics, Mary has helped form a data dashboard in the “Command Center,” a physical space with a data visualization that helps focus meetings with community partners around regularly refreshed neighborhood indicators.

Mary informs partners of the data they need to address problems of homelessness in the community and adjusts what data is on the dashboard based on community feedback. Moreover, Mary explains that for both partners and program funders, being able to demonstrate her findings through Open Data has been essential to receiving grants and calling members of the community to action on the issues she addresses. These efforts also contribute to Mary’s involvement in the Neighborhood Innovation Labs, an initiative of Mayor de Blasio’s administration building on the City’s commitment to modernize public infrastructure, support neighborhood development, and bridge the digital divide.
