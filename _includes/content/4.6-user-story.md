The Participatory Budgeting Project

For the [Participatory Budgeting Project (PBP)](https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/), NYC Open Data has proven useful to informing and maintaining the democratic process of Participatory Budgeting. Hadassah Damien, PBP's Manager of Engagement Technology explains, "There's two ways I use Open Data in my work --- I push others to provide more open data, and I pull by looking at open data that exists and seeing how it can be applied to my work." In both ways, Open Data has been pivotal to the efforts of PBP to bring direct democracy to New Yorkers. Hadassah's team at PBP has contributed to data publishing on Open Data by supporting the New York City Council staff and IT team to [release information](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Participatory-Budgeting-Projects/wwhr-5ven) about community projects funded through participatory budgeting. This helps community members keep track of the implementation status of projects that they and their communities voted to fund. According to Hadassah, "One thing that's great about the open datasets that are available is that they help people learn about their neighborhoods. Community members can use specific datasets that are on the Open Data website to look up the specific metrics about their neighborhood." Hadassah has also worked to leverage Open Data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to index indicators for public health by county to inform future participatory budgeting efforts to improve community health.
