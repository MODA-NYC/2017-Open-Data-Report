## Integrate Open Data into citywide processes.

Open Data is a tool to engage subject matter experts and interested novices in the information their City produces, and give them a voice in the decisions their government makes. As Open Data becomes routine across NYC government, we will look for opportunities to make small changes in existing processes and embed Open Data components into more City initiatives. Last November, the  [Mayor's Office of Technology and Innovation](http://nyc.gov/forward) hosted a "Broadband Data Dig" at the [Brooklyn Public Library](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/). Policy experts, civic technologists, and data scientists together analyzed and developed recommendations for New York City's broadband strategy. The data included a block-level look at broadband availability in New York City (from federal data), as well as development-by-development information about broadband at the [New York City Housing Authority](http://nyc.gov/nycha). Participants used the datasets to help the City develop solutions to address broadband inequities and design broadband data collection and maintenance policies.
