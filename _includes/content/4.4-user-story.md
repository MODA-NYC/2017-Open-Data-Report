NYC Open Data has helped content creators connect their personal experiences with City data to create interesting and informative publications. One of these creators is Shane Leese, a data scientist at real estate platform [RentHop](https://www.renthop.com/). Using Open Data, RentHop models [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) and [Neighborhood Tabulation Areas](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhq) to create informative maps and articles that help people understand their neighborhoods. As Shane explains, NYC Open Data is helpful because he likes "using the open data to get a feel for what's going on in different cities, and New York's got a lot of datasets to choose from." For Shane, everyday experiences have inspired dozens of data visualizations and studies on life in the city. For example, in one [project](https://www.renthop.com/study/new-york-city-ny/summerscore-article.html), Shane tied together data on parks ([Open Space](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Open-Space-Parks-/g84h-jbjm)), bike paths ([Bike Routes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bike-Routes/7vsa-caz7)), bike stations ([CitiBike System Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/Citi-Bike-System-Data/vsnr-94wk)), and sidewalk cafes ([Legally Operating Businesses](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh)) to determine which was the best neighborhood for "summer fun." RentHop, a minority-owned startup that came out of Y Combinator in 2009, has invested in Open Data as a form of business development. By using Open Data to tell compelling, relatable stories, RentHop is expanding its brand in both New York City and other cities.
