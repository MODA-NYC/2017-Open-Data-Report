Manager of Data and Research
University Neighborhood Housing Program

In the Northwest Bronx, Open Data has played a major role in the University Neighborhood Housing Program’s efforts to draw attention to multifamily residences that are physically or financially distressed. As the program’s Vanessa LaNier explains, open data is “a great resource to address a specific problem, and a great research tool to enforce the work that we do and make it stronger.” By retrieving data from the Open Data Portal and other municipal sources, VaNessa and her team have created a database of distressed properties that are in need of care. Known as the Building Indicator Project, the database compiles various indicators of stress, such as building code violations ([Department of Building Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Violations/3h2n-5cm9)), real property data (from the Automated City Register Information System’s Real Property [Legals](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/ACRIS-Real-Property-Legals/8h5j-fqxa), [Parties](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/ACRIS-Real-Property-Parties/636b-3b5g), and [Masters sets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/ACRIS-Real-Property-Master/bnx9-e6tj)), and emergency repair data from 311 complaints (311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present). Based on these wide-ranging indicators, the organization creates individual scores for each multifamily residence, rating their state of distress.  By harnessing the various datasets available through Open Data, Vanessa and the University Neighborhood Housing Program are helping to highlight possible areas for change for greater equity in housing for New Yorkers.
