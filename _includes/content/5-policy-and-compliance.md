# Enforcing Compliance, Improving Policy

Up until this year, the Open Data Law required City agencies to self-submit compliance plans that laid out a timeline for publishing “public datasets.” After a package of amendments to the Open Data Law was passed during the last year, the agency compliance plan became supplemented by the following legal mandates -regarding FOIL, response time for data requests, and update schedules to ensure data doesn’t go stale. These statutory measures collaborate to form a framework for locating data that are, by the Open Data Law, eligible for publication on the Open Data Portal by the end of 2018. In addition to strengthening New York City’s already globally-leading open data policy, the legislation also provides a statutory framework for ensuring that data from all agencies -- not just select high performers -- are accessible, understandable, and usable for everyone. Ensuring the City’s compliance with the Open Data laws and policy is the foundation of a strong and just Open Data for All.

## Data Retention and Archiving

Local Law 106 of 2015 mandates the preservation of the New York City historical record as represented by the City’s official data, ensuring that no records are removed from the Portal. This requirement helps ensure that while data is kept up-it-date, historical information is properly retained and archived for analysis at a later date. For example, DSNY’s PlowNYC map allows New Yorkers see where and when their streets are cleared during a snowstorm, in close to real-time. The web map, however, is only active during snow events; when a winter storm ends, web display is cleared of information. Since last November, all PlowNYC Data has been captured on the Open Data Portal. During the storm, data is updated on the Portal every 15 minutes. Now, all records are retained after the storm, meaning that users can analyze plow data even after the event.

## Metadata standards

Many datasets released on the Open Data Portal are raw data that may never have surfaced outside of an agency. Local Law 107 of 2015 requires every dataset on Open Data to have a plain language data dictionary. Data dictionaries helps define data column and describe how the data was collected. In December, the Open Data team hosted a session with Reinvent Albany and a group of high-frequency Open Data users to collaborate on a new data dictionary template for agencies to use to provide contextual information that is most valuable to the user. Many agencies are now using this template, including the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), which recently published neighborhood air quality data from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS). In addition, thanks to a product-wide update Socrata, each dataset now has a “Primer” -- a unique landing page for each dataset, where information from data dictionaries is imported to guide for users before they dive into the data.

## Geospatial standards

Local Law 108 of 2015 requires that every dataset containing street addresses also a standard format of contain coordinates and political boundaries. These new standards ensure that every agency is writing addresses in the same way so that it’s easier for users to make maps with the City’s data. In September, the Open Data team invited the public to contribute ideas for new address standards. Based on a diverse  set of feedback, the new address standards require agencies to include geospatial fields most frequently captured by City agencies, information that is in highest demand from public users, and attributes that will have the biggest impact on citywide operations once they are standardized. This spring, City Council published its Participatory Budgeting Dataset that fully meets the standards and is easily indexed with other geospatial datasets, details on all of the projects funded through Participatory Budgeting, in which Council Members choose to give at least $1 million from their budget for the whole community to participate in decision-making. Through a public vote, residents then decide which proposals to fund. The Open Data team also released a tracker to check whether eligible datasets have been “geocoded” -- the technical process of matching coordinates to addresses -- to meet the standards.

## Public requests for data

Local Law 109 of 2015 guarantees timely and thorough responses to all public requests for new datasets. This means that when users request new data, Open Data Coordinators are required to take steps to determine whether that data requested can be made public on Open Data. The Department of Buildings (DOB) is one of the most popular data publishers in the City – its “Job Applications Filings” dataset is the most accessed on the Portal. After many users requested access to it, DOB released its Certificate of Occupancy dataset, which details new buildings’ legal use and occupancy. Additionally, when DOB transferred many paper-based processes to DOB NOW, a more efficient digital system, Open Data was a major component due, in part, to public demand. For the first time, the status of new dataset requests can be tracked on the Open Data website.

## Keeping data up-to-date

Local Law 110 of 2015 requires all data published on agency websites to be included and kept up-to-date on Open Data. This ensures that all data that is published elsewhere is centrally discoverable and has the ability to be analyzed with the tools on the Open Data Portal. Earlier this month, the Department of Transportation (DOT) published its real-time traffic speed dataset, which contains records on traffic speed collected from NYCDOT's Traffic Management Center (TMC)’s traffic speed detectors. While these records were previously available in XML data format on the DOT website, they are newly available in an easy-to-use tabular format viewable on the Open Data Portal. This automated dataset, updated every five minutes, is now the Open Data team’s closest to real-time updates.

## FOIL responses including data

Local Law 7 of 2016 requires agencies to review Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests containing data to determine whether they contained new public datasets that could be published on Open Data. This reporting requirement is part of a broader effort to more tightly couple the way agencies respond to FOIL requests and the way that they publish datasets. This year, the Open Data team required that Open Data Coordinators work directly with their agencies’ legal divisions in assembling their dataset inventories and compliance reports, and reached out to agency records officers and general counsels to ensure coordination on the legal front. Open Data is successful only when it becomes a common language at an agency—from its analytics teams to its legal division to its commissioner’s office.

## Examination and Verification

Local Law 8 of 2016 requires MODA to examine three mayoral agencies each year to verify that all public datasets have been disclosed in their publishing plans. Last year, MODA conducted the process with Department of Sanitation (DSNY), Department of Correction (DOC), and Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). MODA found all three agencies to be fully compliant with the requirements laid out by the Open Data Law, and also issued the following recommendations on how to improve citywide compliance with the Open Data law. MODA recommended that agencies should look for ways to ensure that newly collected data can be published as Open Data. For instance, the contract procuring CitiBike’s data infrastructure included a provision mandating that the data collected be made public; because this Open Data requirement was built into the technology itself, the ride data published by CitiBike is easy to access, easy to use, and in high demand. The process is being improved for this year’s examination and verification, including a new data quality check, for the Department of Buildings, Department of Environmental Protection, and the Fire Department.
