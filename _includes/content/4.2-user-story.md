NYC Open Data has helped content creators connect their personal experiences with City data to create interesting and informative publications. One of these creators is Shane Leese, Data Scientist at real estate platform RentHop. Using Open Data, RentHop molds [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) and [Neighborhood Tabulation Areas](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas/cpf4-rkhq) to create informative maps and articles that help people understand their neighborhoods. As Shane explains, NYC Open Data is helpful because he likes “using the open data to get a feel for what’s going on in different cities, and New York’s got a lot of datasets to choose from.” For Shane, everyday experiences have inspired dozens of data visualizations and studies on life in the City.  For example, in one project, Shane tied together data on parks ([Open Space](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Open-Space-Parks-/g84h-jbjm)), bike paths ([Bike Routes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bike-Routes/7vsa-caz7)), bike stations ([CitiBike System Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/Citi-Bike-System-Data/vsnr-94wk)), and sidewalk cafes ([Legally Operating Businesses](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh)) to determine which was the best neighborhood for “summer fun.” Shane and RentHop’s work with NYC Open Data demonstrates how expanded data access has truly helped New Yorkers get to know their City better than ever before.
