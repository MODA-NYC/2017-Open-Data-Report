## Local Law 108 of 2015: Geospatial and Street Address Standards

Local Law 108 of 2015 requires that every public data set containing address information utilize a standard field lay out, and include corresponding community district and geospatial reference data.  It also requires that any agency that cannot utilize the standard field layout report to "the department" (DoITT) and the Council the reasons why it cannot in this report. 

For any dataset on the NYC Open Data Portal that includes row-level address fields, agencies must meet the following standard, as specified in the §4.1.1.2 of the Technical Standards Manual. These attributes should appear on the Portal according to a standard column naming convention. Whenever possible, agencies should separate core address information into five standard column fields: "NUMBER," "STREET," "UNIT," "POSTCODE," and "BOROUGH."

Agencies are also required, with technical guidance from the Open Data team, to include eight standard column fields of core geospatial reference information: "LATITUDE," "LONGITUDE," "COMMUNITY BOARD," "COUNCIL DISTRICT," "CENSUS TRACT," "BIN" (Building Identification Number), "BBL" (Borough-Block-Lot), and "NTA" (Neighborhood Tabulation Area).

The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications and the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics continue to partner with agencies to ensure all data sets meet this standard. For years, agencies have captured information in a number of address formats, maintained in a number of different systems, using a number of technologies.  DoITT underestimated the time needed to execute on this task and are behind schedule in meeting this mandate. As a technology service provider for NYC agencies, DoITT will be doing the majority of this work. Because a large number of agencies will rely on DoITT to fulfill this requirement, this report does not individually specify the reasons agencies are not able to provide core reference data, nor the date in which the agency expects to do so. Even though every dataset that requires core geospatial reference data does not currently have it, DoITT is aggressively exploring all options to make sure this work is completed by **December 31, 2017**.

The following dataset serves as a record of known data sets eligible under this standard, along with the progress that has been made toward standard addresses across all Open Data datasets.

In prioritizing our work to ensure standardized addresses, the team will take into consideration the following criteria:

- **Public feedback** -- We value the thoughts and suggestions of our users, and invite everyone to let us know the data sets they would most quickly like to see include the fields required by this law and technical standard.

- **Data set popularity** -- We will look at metrics including downloads, views, searches, and others in determining the most popular data sets on the portal, which will be prioritized accordingly.

- **Resource availability** -- The Open Data Team and City agencies have varying resource availability throughout the year.  We will prioritize work to ensure efficiency on all ends.

- **Agency needs** -- As more agencies turn to Open Data for data publishing and reporting, we will accordingly prioritize work to help them reach their goals.
