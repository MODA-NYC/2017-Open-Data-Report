## Empower agencies.

By empowering champions in every agency and office, the City narrows the gap between data experts and Open Data users, improving its ability to be a good data steward. This spring, the Open Data team surveyed all Open Data Coordinators (ODCs), the appointed staff within individual agencies who manage data publishing, to better understand their needs. That survey showed that some Coordinators lacked clarity on their role, and what was required of them. The Open Data team responded by implementing a new, simpler data inventorying process. Additionally, the team recruited new ODCs for the smaller offices that make up the “Office of the Mayor,” which were previously served by a single Coordinator. MODA partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Operations this spring to better understand the data ecosystem of City Hall by studying the service areas of individual offices within the Mayor’s administration. The Office of Operations recruited 40 new ODCs from individual mayor’s offices, who in turn identified seven new datasets, which appear on this year’s compliance plan. New data publishers include the Mayor’s Office of Climate Policy and Programs, and the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice.
