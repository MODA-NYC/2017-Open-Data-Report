## Empower agencies.

By empowering champions in every agency and office, the City narrows the gap between data experts and Open Data users, improving its ability to be a good data steward. This spring, the Open Data team surveyed all Open Data Coordinators (ODCs), the appointed staff within individual agencies who manage data publishing, to better understand their needs. That survey showed that some Coordinators lacked clarity on their role, and what was required of them. The Open Data team responded by convening ODCs more regularly and implementing a new, simpler data inventory process. Additionally, the team brought on new ODCs for the smaller offices that make up the "Office of the Mayor," which were previously served by a single Coordinator. MODA partnered with the  [Mayor's Office of Operations](http://nyc.gov/operations) this spring to recruit 40 new ODCs from individual mayor's offices, who in turn identified six new datasets, which appear on this year's compliance plan. New data publishers include the [Mayor's Office of Climate Policy and Programs](http://nyc.gov/climate) and the [Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice](http://nyc.gov/criminaljustice).
